Dataset Introduction
The ML Coursework Dataset was created for the 2024 Machine Learning module assessment. It is made up of data extracted from the FAOSTAT database (https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home), which gives open access to food and agricultural data for over 245 countries and covers years from mid 1990s to present day. 

Dataset Content
The ML Coursework Dataset contains 13 csv files, each covering a category of variables relevant to food and agriculture. See below for the 13 categories covered (with the corresponding FAOSTAT source for each category).
1.	Consumer prices indicators (https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/CP)
2.	Crops production indicators (https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCL)
3.	Emissions (https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GCE & https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GV)
4.	Employment (https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/OEA) 
5.	Exchange rate (https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/PE)
6.	Fertilizers use (https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RFB)
7.	Food balances indicators (https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS)
8.	Food security indicators (https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FS)
9.	Food trade indicators (https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/TCL)
10.	Foreign direct investment (https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FDI)
11.	Land temperature change (https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/ET)
12.	Land use (https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RL)
13.	Pesticides use (https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RP)

See https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#definitions for details about the headers in the data files (Note - ‘Area’ in the headers refers to ‘Country’ in this FAOSTAT glossary). Note that the data files do not have the same number of rows and columns due to differences in the year period and the number of variables (and number of variable sub-categories) covered. However, year and country variables are common to all files. The table below provides a summary of the variables included in each file.
